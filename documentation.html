<h1>Flow Estimator - A Uniform, Steady Open Channel Flow Calculator for QGIS</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This plugin calculates flow and velocity using the Manning equation for uniform, steady flow.  <strong>If you've never heard of the Manning equation or taken a course in open channel hydraulics you won't understand what this tool is doing.</strong></p>

<p>If you are familar with open channel hydraulics and want a quick refresher check out this information from the University of Delaware:</p>

<p>A great reference for Mannings n values can be found from the USGS here:</p>

<h2>User Defined Cross Section</h2>

<p>The user defined cross section option allows loading a tab or space delimited text file without a header.  The first column should contain station values and the second column should contain elevation values.</p>

<h2>Usage Considerations</h2>

<p>Make sure the steady, uniform flow assumption is valid.</p>

<p>When sampling a DEM cross-section be sure to make the cross-section perpendicular to flow at a location that is representative of the stream or drainage channel.</p>

<p>When sampling DEM cross-sections and slopes, make sure the DEM is in the same CRS as the project CRS (but you knew that already right!).</p>
